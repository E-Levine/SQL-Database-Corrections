# SQL-Database-Corrections
Code for performing data corrections on FWRI oyster database data.

Code files are typically named and divided by month and lab of data corrections performed (i.e. 2023 12_St Pete) to help track when data checks are perfromed and on which data. 

Larger datatype specific corrections should be named by data type, and lab or date (YY mm dd) for clarity.

It could be good practice to update the first line of each file with "Applied: [DATE]" when the SQL code has been run and the datacorrections applied to the database.
